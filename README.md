# Week5-Work-Day-Scheduler-Graham
## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule
I want to add important events to a daily planner
So that I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
When I open the planner the current day will be displayed at the 
top of the calendar.
When I scroll down I am presented with colour coded boxes to save any information in. When saved and page refreshed I want info displayed to remain in the boxes.
I start my day at 8am-5pm, when on current hour my box will be red, previous boxes in the past will be grey and any future boxes will be green.
